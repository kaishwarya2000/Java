-> Inheritance - IS-A relationship between a superclass and its subclass

Super Class: The class whose features are inherited is known as a superclass (or a base class or a parent class).
Sub Class: The class that inherits the other class is known as a subclass(or a derived class, extended class, or child class). The subclass can add its own fields and methods in addition to the superclass fields and methods.

When we say that class B is inherited from another class A, then class B is referred to as a subclass (or derived class) and class A is called superclass (or base class).

-> The Number class abstracts various numerical (reference) types such as Byte, Integer, Float, Double, Short, and BigDecimal. Number classbelongs to Object class
java.lang library

Example:

public class Inheritance {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Animal dog = new Dog();
        dog.setId(123); // inherited from super class
        dog.sound(); // overrided behavior of sub class
    }
}

/**
 * This is parent (also called as super or base) class Animal
 *  
 */
class Animal {
    int id;

    public int getId() {
        return id;
    }

    public void setId(int id) {
        this.id = id;
    }

    public void sound() {
        System.out.println("By default it is mute");
    }
}

/**
 * This is subclass (also called as derived or child or extended) Dog which is extending Animal
 * 
 */
class Dog extends Animal {
 
    // Own behavior
    private void bark() {
        System.out.println("Dog '" + getId() + "' is barking");
    }

    // Overriding super class behavior
    @Override
    public void sound() {
        bark();
    }
}

class derived-class extends base-class  
{  
   //methods and fields  
} 


Example 2: In this example, the Programmer is the subclass and the Employee is the superclass. The relationship between the two classes is the Programmer IS-A Employee. It means that a Programmer is a type of Employee.

class Employee{  
    float salary=40000;  
}  
class Programmer extends Employee{  
    int bonus=10000;  
    public static void main(String args[]){  
        Programmer p=new Programmer();  
        System.out.println("Programmer salary is:"+p.salary);  
        System.out.println("Bonus of Programmer is:"+p.bonus);  
    }  
}
